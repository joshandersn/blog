![Games i beat](/img/bg2023.jpg)



---
# Divinity Original Sin II

I like CRPGs now. I have awakened.

---
# Baldurs Gate III

I'm here because of DOS2, Picked it up expecting more turn based magic and it delivered.

---
# Titanfall 2
Beat every achievemnt. Super stupid fun. I actually got into the multiplayer quite a bit and I'm not a big multiplayer guy.

---
# Prey 2017
Beat it 3 times back to back. Love Arkane. Love Immersive Sims.

---
# Resident Evils: 7, 8 and 4 Remake

Village was amazing. I recommend playing on hardcore. The ammo economy is probably the best i've ever seen.

7 was great too. They clearly upped the action on 8 which I think leaves 7 in a good position to stay relevant for a horror game. Same great ammo economy in a tighter enviroment.

4 Remake was fun. I was pleased with what they did with the classic story. a great adaption of the original

---
# Dead Space 2

This game is dope. The graphics, the horror, keeping you reloading every free moment you get is art. I played Dead Space 1 last year and that game was amazing too.

---
# Dishonored 2

I love Dishonored.

My 4 consecutive playthroughs:
- Corvo: low chaos
- Emily: high chaos
- Corvo: Non Leathal, Ghost, Flesh and Steel
- Emily: Non Leathal

---
# Mass Effect

I know this game is known for the role play and choices. But I really love the art style. Peak sci-fi
I'd like to get the legendary collection and go through the trilogy and try the cross game progression.

---
# System Shock 2

Character creation is really cool, I had to start over because I made a bad character and the game was too hard.

Really exited for Nightdive's remaster of SS2. I'll definatlly give it a second run when that comes out

---
# Metro Exodus
This game has a great pace to it. It's like reading a good book (it's based off one). The graphics are fantastic I get cold thinking about it.

---
# Tears of the Kingdom
I got an OLED just for this game. This was the first game I bought on lauch day too.

I really liked TOTK for the first 2 weeks I played it before the burnout set in. The world is largely the same as BOTW's unfortunatly, and there were not nearly enough sky islands as I had hoped. I sought them out because it's some of the only new areas unique to BOTW. 

---
# Tetris Effect Connected

Tetris good

---
# Etropy Zero: 2

Half-life 2 mod with great levels.

---
# Control

Great shooter. I just wish it was harder. not like more enemy health. I dont know...

Amazing destruction effects. like holy crap.

---
# Deus Ex: Mankind Divided

People dont hate this game because the original Deus Ex is better, its because Pritchard isn't in it and no he shouldn't be behind a DLC

---
# Alan Wake's American Nightmare

Basically Alan Wake DLC. Short, fun, has an arcade mode (It's really good)

---
# Alien Isolation

Literaly a perfect game. Put it in a museum. Historical

---
# Alan Wake

Really enganging playable TV show. Good game

---
# Quake II

Nightdive's remaster on switch has keyboard and mouse support. Not kidding plug a mouse and a keyboard into your nintendo switch.

---
# Mirrors Edge

It's called mirrors edge because runners run across windows. they're on the edge. the edge of the mirror

---
# Assassin's Creed II

Ezio can stab anybody, I bet he couldn't stab the pope

Ezio:

---
# Dark Messiah of Might and Magic

Men want one thing and it's to kick goblins.

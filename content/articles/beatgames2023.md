# Divinity OG Shin II & Baldurs Door III
Divinity original sin II beat Baldurs Gate 3 for me. While BG3 has loads of more interactivity and sheer scale, DOS2 still had a more solid and satisfying level progression. 

Every fight I had in DOS2 had me feeling like a genius. With BG3 the combat is more complex and I think it has good a reason to be. I found myself ignoring a lot of generally useful spell i had idioticly looked over untill the late game.

Please understand that BG3 *is* DnD, if you think of something you can do, the developers have thought about it, and maybe they added it in.

# Titanfall 2
Good gosh titanfall 2 is good. It's the best feeling movement shooter I've ever played. This game had me beat every achievement before I even knew it. I strongly recommended it to anyone who's into Call of Duty and hasn't played it yet.

# Prey 2017
Immersive sims are my favorite type of game hands down. Prey had me beat it 3 times in a row. 2nd favorite arkane game

# Resident Evils: 7, 8 and 4 Remake

I started out with RE:Village when it when on sale on the Mac App store. My only prior experience with the franchise was the original RE:4. 

Village was amazing. playing on hardcore all the ammo was perfectly tight and unforgiving, giving this amazing horror expirence.

7 was great too. They clearly upped the action on 8 which I think leaves 7 in a good position to stay relevant for a horror game. Same great ammo economy in a tighter and less forgiving enviorment.

4 Remake was fun. Really fun.

# Dead Space 2

Favorite survival horror game. Dead Space 1 has some great sequences to expierence.

---
# Dishonored 2

It's Dishonored 2, Better graphics, more mechanics, bigger more complex levels. Punch takedown. Amazing game, Arkane never misses (haven't played redfall though)

Back to back playthroughs:

Corvo: low chaos

Emily: high chaos

Corvo: Non Leathal, Ghost, Flesh and Steel

Emily: Non Leathal

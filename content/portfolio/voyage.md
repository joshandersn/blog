# Voyage and Beyond

Back in 2018, I made two albums in my free time. I thought the music I made was suitable for anyone interested in ambient music. While I'm skeptical of the work I did so early in my music-producing journey, I still enjoy the tracks I made and am proud of my work.

Voyage was made completely in garage band using various plugins from Native Intruments.

Beyond was made a few months after Voyage, when I switched my DAW to Logic Pro, which gave me tools to create more complicated effects.

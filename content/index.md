This is my first project I plan to release on Steam and hopefully consoles. It's inspired by games like Geometry Wars, and WipEout.
 
The gist is you ride around at high speeds. Ram enemies to unlock upgrades you can install anywhere on your ship. The game will throw continuously harder enemies at you so choose your upgrades well.
 
This game has been in development since April 2024. Hopefully I will have it done this year. So anywho  Here are some screenshots.
